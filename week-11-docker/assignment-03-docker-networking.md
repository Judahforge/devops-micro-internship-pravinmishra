# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker network types and deploy applications using different networking modes: the default bridge network, a custom bridge network for microservices, multiple networks for a multi-tier architecture, and host networking.

---

# Task 1 — Deploy a Standalone Application Using Docker Bridge Network

## Goal

List Docker networks, verify/pull the Nginx image, run an Nginx container (`myweb`) on the default bridge network with port 80 mapped, and verify it's reachable from a browser via the VM's public IP.

### Evidence

# Task 2 — Connect Multiple Containers Using a Custom Bridge Network

## Goal

Create a custom bridge network `mynetwork`, build and run a Node/Express `frontend` container and an Nginx `backend` container on it, and verify they can communicate by container name.

# Task 3 — Deploy a Multi-Tier Application Using Multiple Docker Networks

## Goal

Build a three-tier app (frontend, backend, MongoDB) across `backend-network` (backend ↔ database) and `frontend-network` (frontend ↔ backend), and verify data flows end to end.

### Evidence
